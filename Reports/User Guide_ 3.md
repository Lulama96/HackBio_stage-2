**Step 6: Review Results**

* The results will display:  
  * **Volume of Stock Solution Needed**: How much of the stock solution you should use.  
  * **Volume of Solvent Needed**: The amount of solvent (usually water) to add to the stock solution.  
  * **Example Result**:  
    * Volume of Stock Solution Needed: 5 mL  
    * Volume of Solvent Needed: 45 mL

## **Example:**

You need to prepare 50 mL of a 20 mg/mL solution from a 200 mg/mL stock solution.

# **Molarity Calculator on R Dashboard**

**Accessing the R Dashboard**

1. **Open Your Browser**: Launch your preferred web browser.  
2. **Enter the R Dashboard URL**: Type in the URL provided by your administrator to access the R dashboard.

### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

#### **Step 1: Locate the Molarity Calculator on “Laboratory Reagent Preparation calculators”**

* **Find the Section**: Look for the "Molarity Calculator" section on the main dashboard. It should be clearly labelled and easily accessible from the main menu.

#### **Step 2: Input Mass of Solute**

* **Enter Mass**: In the "Mass of Solute" field, input the amount of solute you have in grams.  
  * **Example**: For a solute mass of 5 g, enter 5.

#### **Step 3: Input Molecular Weight**

* **Enter Molecular Weight**: In the "Molecular Weight" field, input the molecular weight of the solute in grams per mole (g/mol).

#### **A guide for Buffer Preparation**

#### If you want to calculate the volume of stock buffer solution needed to prepare a buffer solution with a specific concentration and volume using a more concentrated stock solution.

#### The formula used in the calculation is: 

#### Volume of stock solution \= (Desired concentration × Desired volume) / Stock concentration

#### **Step-by-Step Guide:**

#### **1\. Open the App**

#### Open the RShiny app. You will then see the title "Laboratory Reagent Preparation Calculators" and tabs for various calculations.

#### **2\. Navigate to the Buffer Preparation Tab**

#### Click on the "Buffer Preparation" tab found on the left-hand sidebar. This tab is created for calculating the buffer stock solution volume.

#### **3\. Input the Buffer Concentration (M)**

#### In the box  "Desired Buffer Concentration (M)", input the concentration of the buffer solution that you want to prepare.

#### •	For example: If you want to prepare a buffer solution with a concentration of 0.1 M, enter 0.1.

#### **4\. Input the Desired Buffer Volume (L)**

#### In the box "Desired Buffer Volume (L)", enter the total volume of the buffer solution that you wish to prepare.

#### •	For example: If you want to prepare 0.5 L of buffer solution, enter 0.5.

#### **5\. Input the Stock Solution Concentration (M)**

#### In the box "Stock Solution Concentration (M)", enter the concentration of the stock buffer solution that you have in the lab.

#### •	For example: If your stock buffer has a concentration of 1 M, enter 1\.

#### **6\. Select "Calculate Volume of Stock Solution"**

#### Once all the required values are entered in the fields:

#### •	Select the button marked "Calculate Volume of Stock Solution".

#### **7\. Check the Calculation Results**

#### The app will now calculate and display the volume of the stock solution you require to prepare your buffer solutions. 

#### **Example Scenario:**

#### You want to prepare 500 mL (0.5 L) of a 0.1 M buffer solution using a 1 M stock solution. Here's how you'd input the values:

#### •	Desired Buffer Concentration: 0.1 M

#### •	Desired Buffer Volume: 0.5 L

#### •	Stock Solution Concentration: 1 M

#### Expected answer: 0.05L \= 50mL
